-- Part IV of Laboratory Exercise 4 (Counters) :
-- Design and implement a circuit that successively flashes digits 0 through 9
-- on the 7-segment display HEX0. Each digit should be displayed for about one second.
-- Use a counter to determine the one-second intervals. The counter should be incremented
-- by the 50-MHz clock signal provided on the DE2 board. Do not derive any other clock signals
-- in your design make sure that all flip-flops in your circuit are clocked directly by the 50 MHz clock signal.

-- 50MHZ = 5e7HZ
-- 1s --> 1HZ
